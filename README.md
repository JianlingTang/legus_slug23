### The SLUG Bayesian Modelling of LEGUS Cluster Demographics Pipeline (2023)

## Dependencies 

1. Install the slug source code from https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/slug2/src/master/ before using any of the analytical Python tools in this directory.

2. Include Dan Foreman-Mackey's emcee package from https://github.com/dfm/emcee.

3. Git pull the cluster library from [INSERT HYPERLINK OF CLUSTER_SLUG LIBRARY HERE].

## Repository Workflow:

1. Download the cluster catalog files from public data. The NGC 628 c and e cluster catalogs are located in the /cluster_catalogs directory.

2. Run `analyze_catalog_mid_midd.py` by typing `./analyze_catalog_mid_mdd.sh` in the main directory. This will produce the chains resulting from running the MCMC trials. The previous chains returned by running the analyzing scripts are included. The shell scripts contain the absolute paths of each input data file. You'll need to update the paths and filenames according to your own directory names.

3. Generate the plots using `plot_mag.py`, `plot_color_mag.py`, and `plot_stack.py`. These scripts generate all plots appearing in the paper.


## Layout 

`chains/`: this directory contains the MCMC chains returned by running the `analyze_catalog_mid_mdd.py` and `analyze_divide.py`.

`cluster_catalogs/`: this directory contains the input cluster catalog files of the galaxy.

`completeness_data/`: this directory contains all the pre-computed completeness values of the library and the observations. These files can be generated by using the functions in `completeness_calculators.py`.

`phot_pct/`: this directory contains the pre-computed luminosity PDFs at different percentiles.

`analyze_catalog_mid_mdd.py`: this script performs the MCMC optimization of the model parameters.

`analyze_catalog_mid_mdd.sh`: this script executes the `analyze_catalog_mid_mdd.py` script with arguments.

`analyze_divide.py`: this script performs the MCMC optimization of the model parameters by grouping the full catalog using different criteria.

`catalog_readers.py`: this script reads the catalog file and organizes them.

`completeness_calculators.py`: this script calculates the completeness values given a set of input photometry.

`divide_legus.py`: this script divides the full catalog into sub-groups.

`plot_color_mag.py`: this script plots the PDFs of color versus magnitudes.

`plot_color_mag.sh`: this script runs the `plot_color_mag.py` with specified arguments.

`plot_mag.py`: this script plots the PDFs of magnitudes in various filters.

`plot_mag.sh`: this script runs the `plot_mag.py` with specified arguments.

`plot_stack.py`: this script plots the comparison of sub-groups of the cluster demographics.

`plot_stack.sh`: this script runs the `plot_stack.py` with specified arguments.
